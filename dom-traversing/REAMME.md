## DOM traversal and manipulation with JS

This module is an introduction to javascript and the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is an interface object which represents the output HTML as a tree of element objects. This tree is read by the browser to create the output HTML. Each node in the tree is an object with multiple parameters. Understanding, manipulating, and selecting these objects is at the heart of what makes Javascript run in the browser so powerful. 

The goal of this lesson is to learn to traverse, manipulate, read, and understand the properties of the DOM and the elements that drive its structure.
