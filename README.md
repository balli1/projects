# pseudo classes
Assignment: Building off of the previous assignments - 1)When hovered over a dot, have the dot grow in size. Use transition and transform on the hover state. 2) When hovered over a dot, add a notification circle on top and then have it go away when you move away. Use the before element. 3) When tabbing, show the selection border on each dot. The border shouldn't adjust in size (make inset).
